# Seasonal forcing model



## Overview

Aim of this section:

-   Illustrate the forcing model based on the book Modeling Infectious Diseases in Humans and Animals by Matt Keeling and Pejman Rohani[@keeling2008]

-   Understanding the mechanisms that generate periodic outbreaks of childhood infectious diseases

-   Use odin package to generate the model with time varying transmission rate.

## Historical background

Arthur Ransome settled on changes in the **density of susceptibles** as the most likely explanation for mechanisms that may generate regular epidemics of measles, whooping cough, and smallpox.

Exanthematous diseases wipe out nearly all **susceptibles** and, as a consequence, must necessarily **wait a number of years** before the requisite nearness of susceptible individuals has been again secured.

Case report data for measles, which conforms well to the assumptions of the SIR model, show **large amplitude** recurrent epidemics with very dramatic **peaks and troughs**.

=\> This is in **direct contrast** to the **equilibrium dynamics** predicted by simple models, with a **steady incidence of disease**.

### Soper study

Focusing on the monthly case reports for measles in Glasgow from 1905‚Äì1916, [@soper1929]proceeded to estimate relative transmission rates per month. His methodology centered on the argument that:

$$\frac{cases\ this\ interval}{cases\ last\ interval} \sim \frac {Number\ of\ susceptibles\ now}{Equilibrium\ number\ of\ susceptibles'} $$ which can be expressed as the following equation:

$$(\frac{C_{t+1}}{C_{t}})^{\alpha}=k_{\theta}\frac{X_{t+1}}{X^{*}}$$ Where:

-   $\alpha$: realistic infection(the sum of the infectious and latent periods), $\alpha$ = 0.2

-   $k_{0}$: the factor representing the influence of season $\theta$

-   $X_{*}$: mean number of susceptibles, equivalent to 70 week's cases reports

-   At the peak of an epidemic, $C_{t+1} \sim C_{t}$,we have an initial estimate for $X_{t+1}$, which can be updated by adding the documented births and subtracting the number of cases

=\> All that remains now is to fit the seasonality parameter $k_{\theta}$

![](img/sea_force/contact_parm.png)

=\> **Estimated transmission was very low in the summer months, and peaked dramatically in the early autumn (October)**.

### London and Yorke study

[@london1973] interested in exploring seasonal influences on transmission, and estimated the mean monthly transmission rates for measles, mumps, and chickenpox in New York City from 1935 to 1972. Key concept:

-   Number of susceptibles ($X_{p}$) has the same value at the peak of every outbreak

-   The number of infectious individuals (Y) has reached its maximum, therefore $\frac{dY}{dt} = 0$

$$\frac{dY}{dt} = 0 => \beta XY/N - \gamma Y = 0 => X=X_{p} = \frac{\gamma N}{\beta}$$

At the start of the epidemic year, the number of susceptibles = $X_{p}$ + cumulative number of reported cases for that year.

Then, by using a discrete-time model, they were able to explore the pattern of transmission rates that provided model exposures consistent with the observed case reports.

=\> They also found a clearly **seasonal pattern** of transmission for all three diseases, with a **peak** that coincided with the **start of school terms** in the autumn and a **trough** that occurred during the **summer months**

### More later studies

Since then, more mechanistic approaches for the estimation of transmission rates have been developed, which involve a more detailed **‚Äúreconstruction‚Äù of the number of susceptibles** in the population.

First [@fine1982] and later [@finkenst√§dt2000]used used **case report data** for measles in England and Wales, together with information on the **population size** and **birth rates** to estimate transmission rates.

üìå **A range of statistical approaches have revealed that transmission of childhood infections varies seasonally, peaking at the start of the school year and declining significantly in the summer months.**

## Modelling forcing in childhood infectious diseases: measles

These studies started with the work of [@soper1929],[@bartlett1956], and [@bailey1975], who incorporated seasonality in SIR models with the primary aim of establishing the amplitude of variation in contact rates necessary to produce the observed 80% fluctuation in epidemics.

It is often difficult to consider the forcing of childhood infections without considering age structured models. Throughout this chapter, age structure is ignored for simplicity

[@bailey1975] explored a simplified SIR model:

$$\frac{dX}{dt} =  \mu N - \beta(t) X Y/N $$

$$\frac{dY}{dt} =  \beta(t) X Y/N - \gamma Y $$ where:

-   $\mu$ is the per capita birth rate

-   $\gamma$ is the recovery rate from the infection

The transmission rate is a function of time, Œ≤(t), and was taken by Bailey to be a sinusoid:

$$\beta(t) = \beta_{0}(1+\beta_{1}cos(\omega t))$$

where:

-   $\beta_{0}$: the baseline or average transmission rate

-   $\omega$: the period of the forcing ($\frac {2 \pi}{time~unit}$,1 year = $\frac{2 \pi}{1}$)

-   $\beta_{1}$: the amplitude of seasonality

```{r,message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)


generate_omega_seq <- function(start = 1, end = 3, step = 0.5) {
  time_units <- seq(start, end, by = step)
  omega_seq <- (2 * 3.14) / time_units
  return(omega_seq)
}


t = seq(0,5,le = 1001)

beta_0 <- seq(0.5,5,by = .5)
omega <- generate_omega_seq()
beta_1 <- seq(0.5,5,by = .5)




dt <- expand.grid(t,beta_0,omega,beta_1) 
colnames(dt) <- c("t","beta_0","omega","beta_1")
dt1 <- dt %>% mutate(beta = beta_0*(1 + beta_1*cos(omega*t)))

ojs_define(data = dt1)
```

```{ojs}
ojsdata = transpose(data)

viewof beta_0 = Inputs.range(
  [1, 5], 
  {value: 1, step: 1, label: "beta_0"}
)


viewof omega = Inputs.radio(
    [6.28, 4.1867, 3.1400, 2.5120, 2.0933], 
    {value:6.28,label: "Omega"})

viewof beta_1 = Inputs.range(
  [0.5, 5], 
  {value: 0.5, step: 0.5, label: "beta_1"}
)

ojsdata_filtered = ojsdata.filter(function(circle){
  return circle.beta_0 == beta_0 & circle.beta_1 == beta_1 & circle.omega == omega})
```

```{ojs}
Plot.plot({
  y: {grid: true, label: "Beta"},
  marks: [
    Plot.lineY(ojsdata_filtered, {x: "t", y: "beta", stroke: "steelblue"}),
    Plot.lineY(ojsdata_filtered, {x: "t", y: "beta_0", stroke: "red"})
  ]
})
```

To explore the dynamics of small perturbations to the unforced equilibrium, Bailey made substitutions $X = X‚àó(1 + x)$ and $Y = Y ‚àó(1 + y)$, after omitting some intermediate steps, gives a second order differential equation in the small infectious perturbation y:

$$\frac{d^{2}y}{dt^{2}}+\mu R_{0} \frac{dy}{dt}+\mu \beta y = -\beta_{1} \omega \gamma sin(\omega t)$$

The period of the oscillations is the same as the period of the forcing, the amplitude of oscillations (M):

$$M = \beta_{1}\omega \gamma \{(\mu \beta_{0}-\omega^{2})^{2} + (\omega \mu R_{0})^{2}\}^{-\frac {1}{2}} $$

Making the appropriate substitutions for measles, we set $\frac{1}{\gamma} = 2$, $\mu R_{0} \sim 0.014$ and $\omega = \frac{\pi}{26}$ (taking the week as our basic time unit) =\> $M \sim 7.76 \beta_{1}$ ( 10% variation in the transmission parameter translates into seasonal variations of 78% in case notifications)

*Butterfly effect: "A butterfly flaps its wings in the Amazon rainforest, and subsequently a hurricane forms in Texas,"*

üìå **Relatively modest levels of variation in the transmission rate can translate into large amplitude fluctuations in the observed disease incidence**

### Dynamical Consequences of Seasonality: Harmonic and Subharmonic Resonance

The first systematic examination of seasonality affecting the dynamical pattern of epidemics was made by Klaus Dietz. Dietz carried out a stability analysis of the familiar SIR model:

$$\frac{dX}{dt} =  \mu N - (\beta(t) \frac {Y}{N} + \mu) X$$

$$\frac{dY}{dt} =  \beta(t) X \frac {Y}{N} - (\mu + \gamma) Y $$

where $\beta(t) = \beta_{0}(1-\beta_{1}cos(\omega t))$ ( he used a minus sign in his formulation in order to ensure that contact rates were at their lowest at the start of the epidemic year)

```{r,echo=TRUE}
curve(1*(1 - 0.5*cos(2*pi*time)), 0, 6,
      n = 1001, xname = "time", xlab = "Time", ylab = "Transmission rate")
```

He demonstrated that in the absence of seasonal forcing, the system fluctuated with frequency F:

$$F^{2} = \mu (\gamma + \mu)(R_{0}-1) - (\frac{\mu R_{0}}{2})^{2}$$

in many realistic situation $\mu R_{0} \ll 1$. Dietz pointed out that for cases in which the natural period of oscillations in the SIR model are approximately the same as that of the seasonal forcing (i.e., F ‚âà œâ), we observe ***harmonic resonance***, where model dynamics mimic those of the forcing, although the amplitude of oscillations may be greatly increased.

For different ratios of $\frac {\omega}{F}$, however, it is possible for forcing to excite sub-harmonic resonance that gives rise to oscillations with a longer period than the period of the forcing. This phenomenon can occur whenever the natural period of the oscillations $\frac {1}{F}$ is close to an *integer* multiple of the period of the forcing $\frac {1}{\omega}$

![](img/sea_force/a.png)

üìå **Forcing is most greatly amplified when the forcing period is close to the natural oscillatory frequency of the unforced dynamics.**

### How the amplitude of seasonality affects dynamics

Changes in either $R_{0}$ or $\beta_{1}$ can lead to qualitatively different epidemic patterns:

-   Top left: $R_{0}$ is large, level of seasonal forcing is small =\> fraction of infecteds (small-amplitude annual epidemics)

-   Middle left: $\beta_{1} = 0.1$ =\> we observe subharmonic resonance (as $\omega$ $\approx$ 2F), biennial dynamics

-   Bottom left: a further increase in $\beta_{1}$ =\> four-year cycles

-   Second and third columns: $R_{0}$ is smaller, increases in seasonal amplitude =\> do not influence the period of epidemics (remain annual), but alter the magnitude of oscillations

![](img/sea_force/b.png)

üìå **In the absence of seasonal forcing, the SIR family of models exhibit a stable equilibrium. The introduction of time-dependent transmission rates can generate a variety of dynamical patterns‚Äîdepending on parameter values‚Äîranging from simple annual epidemics to multiennial outbreaks and eventually chaos.**

## Mechanisms of Multi-Annual Cycles

The condition for growth of disease incidence is:

$$\begin{align}
\frac {dY}{dt} &= \beta X \frac {Y}{N} - (\gamma + \mu) Y > 0 \\
&= Y (\gamma + \mu) (R_{0}\frac{X}{N}-1) >0   \\
&\Rightarrow \frac{X}{N} >\frac{1}{R_{0}} \approx \frac{\gamma}{\beta} 
\end{align}$$

The spread only occur when a sufficient fraction of susceptible higher a critical value determined by $R_{0}$

## Forcing function

We've explored seasonality by assuming that the transmission rate is time dependent and specifically is determined by a simple sinusoidal function, this view has changed in recent years:

-   seasonally forced models of childhood infections now more often use a square wave

-   the transmission rate is assumed to be high during school terms and low at other times

$$\beta(t)=\beta_{0}(1+b_{1}Term(t))$$

where:

-   $Term(t)$ is +1 during the school term and ‚àí1 at other times.

-   $b_{1}$ to represent the amplitude of seasonality

To ensure R0 is constant irrespective of the precise forcing function used and the amplitude of seasonality. If there are $D+$ days of school and $D‚àí$ holidays, then our forcing function would be:

$$\beta(t)=\frac{\beta_{0}}{\frac{1}{365}((1+b_{1})D_{+}+(1-b_{1})D_{-})}(1+b_{1}Term(t))$$

### Compare 2 methods

**The choice of functional form used to represent seasonality in the transmission term can have a substantial qualitative, as well as quantitative, dynamical effect**

Two-dimensional bifurcation figures below show results using a fixed set of initial conditions tend to show more multiennial cycles.

![corrected term-time SEIR-force model](img/sea_force/bifur_term.png)
:::

-   With the mean transmission rate fixed at 1,250 per year, the bifurcation from annual to biennial epidemics occurs at a larger amplitude of seasonality for the term-time forcing ($b1 \sim 0.1285$ compared with $\beta_{1} \sim 0.0455$).

-   The term-time forced models exhibit biennial epidemics for a far larger region of the parameter space with irregular (quasiperiodic or chaotic) outbreaks observed only once b1 exceeds approximately 0.6 (compared to $\beta_{1}$ \> 0.2)

-   The sinusoidal-forced model generates very large amplitude dynamics with the proportion of infectives often falling below $10^{-20}$ when $\beta_{1}$ is large, term-time forcing the proportion of infectives in the troughs of epidemics always exceeds $10^{-10}$

## Conclusion

![Gray line: measles data and standard error, black-solid: sinusoidal, dotted line: corrected term forced model](img/sea_force/model_compare.png)

| Seasonal forcing | Term time      | Sinusoidal        |
|------------------|----------------|-------------------|
| Best fit         | $b_{1} = 0.29$ | $beta_{1} = 0.11$ |
| Associated error | $E_{v} = 1.18$ | $beta_{1} = 0.64$ |

-   The best-fit model with **sinusoidal forcing** results in a lower error because it more accurately captures the timing of the epidemic peak.

-   The best-fit model with **term-time forcing** generates an epidemic peak that is slightly delayed, even though it captures more of the qualitative properties of the **biennial cycle**.

üìå This discrepancy highlights the need for extra biological detail: A more realistic distribution for the latent and infectious periods or including age structure greatly reduces the error associated with term-time forcing.
